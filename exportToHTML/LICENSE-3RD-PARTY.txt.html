          <span class="s0">the Derivative Works; and</span>

      <span class="s0">(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its</span>

          <span class="s0">or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided</span>
          <span class="s0">that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed</span>
          <span class="s0">as modifying the License.</span>

      <span class="s0">You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and</span>
      <span class="s0">may provide additional or different license terms and conditions</span>
      <span class="s0">for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or</span>

      <span class="s0">the conditions stated in this License.</span>

   <span class="s0">5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,</span>

      <span class="s0">by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of</span>
      <span class="s0">this License, without any additional terms or conditions.</span>
      <span class="s0">Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify</span>
      <span class="s0">the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed</span>
      <span class="s0">with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</span>

   <span class="s0">6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade</span>
      <span class="s0">names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,</span>

      <span class="s0">whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,</span>
      <span class="s0">unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly</span>
      <span class="s0">negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be</span>
      <span class="s0">liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,</span>
      <span class="s0">incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a</span>

   <span class="s0">9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing</span>
      <span class="s0">the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,</span>
      <span class="s0">and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,</span>
      <span class="s0">or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this</span>
      <span class="s0">License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only</span>

 <span class="s0">Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.</span>
 <span class="s0">51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA</span>
 <span class="s0">Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies</span>
 <span class="s0">of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</span>

<span class="s0">[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts</span>
 <span class="s0">as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence</span>
 <span class="s0">the version number 2.1.]</span>

                            <span class="s0">Preamble</span>

  <span class="s0">The licenses for most software are designed to take away your</span>
<span class="s0">freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public</span>
<span class="s0">Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change</span>
<span class="s0">free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</span>

  <span class="s0">This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some</span>
<span class="s0">specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the</span>
<span class="s0">Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You</span>
<span class="s0">can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether</span>
<span class="s0">this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better</span>
<span class="s0">strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.</span>

  <span class="s0">When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,</span>
<span class="s0">not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that</span>
<span class="s0">you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge</span>
<span class="s0">for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get</span>
<span class="s0">it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of</span>
<span class="s0">it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do</span>
<span class="s0">these things.</span>

  <span class="s0">To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</span>
<span class="s0">distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these</span>
<span class="s0">rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for</span>
<span class="s0">you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.</span>

  <span class="s0">For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis</span>
<span class="s0">or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave</span>
<span class="s0">you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source</span>
<span class="s0">code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide</span>
<span class="s0">complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them</span>
<span class="s0">with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling</span>
<span class="s0">it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</span>

  <span class="s0">We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the</span>
<span class="s0">library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal</span>
<span class="s0">permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</span>

  <span class="s0">To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that</span>
<span class="s0">there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is</span>
<span class="s0">modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know</span>
<span class="s0">that what they have is not the original version, so that the original</span>
<span class="s0">author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be</span>
<span class="s0">introduced by others.</span>

  <span class="s0">Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of</span>
<span class="s0">any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot</span>
<span class="s0">effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a</span>
<span class="s0">restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that</span>
<span class="s0">any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be</span>
<span class="s0">consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.</span>

  <span class="s0">Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the</span>
<span class="s0">ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser</span>
<span class="s0">General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and</span>
<span class="s0">is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use</span>
<span class="s0">this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those</span>
<span class="s0">libraries into non-free programs.</span>

  <span class="s0">When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using</span>
<span class="s0">a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a</span>
<span class="s0">combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary</span>
<span class="s0">General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the</span>
<span class="s0">entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General</span>
<span class="s0">Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with</span>
<span class="s0">the library.</span>

  <span class="s0">We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it</span>
<span class="s0">does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General</span>
<span class="s0">Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less</span>
<span class="s0">of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages</span>
<span class="s0">are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many</span>
<span class="s0">libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain</span>
<span class="s0">special circumstances.</span>

  <span class="s0">For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to</span>
<span class="s0">encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes</span>
<span class="s0">a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be</span>
<span class="s0">allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free</span>
<span class="s0">library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this</span>
<span class="s0">case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free</span>
<span class="s0">software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.</span>

  <span class="s0">In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free</span>
<span class="s0">programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of</span>
<span class="s0">free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in</span>
<span class="s0">non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU</span>
<span class="s0">operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating</span>
<span class="s0">system.</span>

  <span class="s0">Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the</span>
<span class="s0">users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is</span>
<span class="s0">linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run</span>
<span class="s0">that program using a modified version of the Library.</span>

  <span class="s0">The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</span>
<span class="s0">modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The</span>
<span class="s0">former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must</span>
<span class="s0">be combined with the library in order to run.</span>

                  <span class="s0">GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</span>
   <span class="s0">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</span>

  <span class="s0">0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other</span>
<span class="s0">program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or</span>
<span class="s0">other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of</span>
<span class="s0">this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).</span>
<span class="s0">Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</span>

  <span class="s0">A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data</span>
<span class="s0">prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs</span>
<span class="s0">(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</span>

  <span class="s0">The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work</span>
<span class="s0">which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the</span>
<span class="s0">Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under</span>
<span class="s0">copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a</span>
<span class="s0">portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated</span>
<span class="s0">straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is</span>
<span class="s0">included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)</span>

  <span class="s0">&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for</span>
<span class="s0">making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means</span>
<span class="s0">all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated</span>
<span class="s0">interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation</span>
<span class="s0">and installation of the library.</span>

  <span class="s0">Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</span>
<span class="s0">covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of</span>
<span class="s0">running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from</span>
<span class="s0">such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based</span>
<span class="s0">on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for</span>
<span class="s0">writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does</span>
<span class="s0">and what the program that uses the Library does.</span>

  <span class="s0">1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's</span>
<span class="s0">complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that</span>
<span class="s0">you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an</span>
<span class="s0">appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact</span>
<span class="s0">all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any</span>
<span class="s0">warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the</span>
<span class="s0">Library.</span>

  <span class="s0">You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,</span>
<span class="s0">and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a</span>
<span class="s0">fee.</span>

  <span class="s0">2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion</span>
<span class="s0">of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and</span>
<span class="s0">distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1</span>
<span class="s0">above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</span>

    <span class="s0">a) The modified work must itself be a software library.</span>

    <span class="s0">b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices</span>
    <span class="s0">stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</span>

    <span class="s0">c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no</span>
    <span class="s0">charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</span>

    <span class="s0">d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a</span>
    <span class="s0">table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses</span>
    <span class="s0">the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility</span>
    <span class="s0">is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,</span>
    <span class="s0">in the event an application does not supply such function or</span>
    <span class="s0">table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of</span>
    <span class="s0">its purpose remains meaningful.</span>

    <span class="s0">(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has</span>
    <span class="s0">a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the</span>
    <span class="s0">application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any</span>
    <span class="s0">application-supplied function or table used by this function must</span>
    <span class="s0">be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square</span>
    <span class="s0">root function must still compute square roots.)</span>

<span class="s0">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If</span>
<span class="s0">identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,</span>
<span class="s0">and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in</span>
<span class="s0">themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those</span>
<span class="s0">sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you</span>
<span class="s0">distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based</span>
<span class="s0">on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</span>
<span class="s0">this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the</span>
<span class="s0">entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote</span>
<span class="s0">it.</span>

<span class="s0">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest</span>
<span class="s0">your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to</span>
<span class="s0">exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or</span>
<span class="s0">collective works based on the Library.</span>

<span class="s0">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library</span>
<span class="s0">with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of</span>
<span class="s0">a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under</span>
<span class="s0">the scope of this License.</span>

  <span class="s0">3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public</span>
<span class="s0">License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do</span>
<span class="s0">this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so</span>
<span class="s0">that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,</span>
<span class="s0">instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the</span>
<span class="s0">ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify</span>
<span class="s0">that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in</span>
<span class="s0">these notices.</span>

  <span class="s0">Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for</span>
<span class="s0">that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all</span>
<span class="s0">subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</span>

  <span class="s0">This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of</span>
<span class="s0">the Library into a program that is not a library.</span>

  <span class="s0">4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or</span>
<span class="s0">derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form</span>
<span class="s0">under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany</span>
<span class="s0">it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which</span>
<span class="s0">must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a</span>
<span class="s0">medium customarily used for software interchange.</span>

  <span class="s0">If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy</span>
<span class="s0">from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the</span>
<span class="s0">source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to</span>
<span class="s0">distribute the source code, even though third parties are not</span>
<span class="s0">compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</span>

  <span class="s0">5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the</span>
<span class="s0">Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or</span>
<span class="s0">linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a</span>
<span class="s0">work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and</span>
<span class="s0">therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</span>

  <span class="s0">However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library</span>
<span class="s0">creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it</span>
<span class="s0">contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the</span>
<span class="s0">library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.</span>
<span class="s0">Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</span>

  <span class="s0">When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file</span>
<span class="s0">that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a</span>
<span class="s0">derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.</span>
<span class="s0">Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be</span>
<span class="s0">linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The</span>
<span class="s0">threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</span>

  <span class="s0">If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data</span>
<span class="s0">structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline</span>
<span class="s0">functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object</span>
<span class="s0">file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative</span>
<span class="s0">work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the</span>
<span class="s0">Library will still fall under Section 6.)</span>

  <span class="s0">Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may</span>
<span class="s0">distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.</span>
<span class="s0">Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,</span>
<span class="s0">whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.</span>

  <span class="s0">6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or</span>
<span class="s0">link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a</span>
<span class="s0">work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work</span>
<span class="s0">under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit</span>
<span class="s0">modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse</span>
<span class="s0">engineering for debugging such modifications.</span>

  <span class="s0">You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the</span>
<span class="s0">Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by</span>
<span class="s0">this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work</span>
<span class="s0">during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the</span>
<span class="s0">copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference</span>
<span class="s0">directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one</span>
<span class="s0">of these things:</span>

    <span class="s0">a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding</span>
    <span class="s0">machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever</span>
    <span class="s0">changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under</span>
    <span class="s0">Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked</span>
    <span class="s0">with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that</span>
    <span class="s0">uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the</span>
    <span class="s0">user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified</span>
    <span class="s0">executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood</span>
    <span class="s0">that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the</span>
    <span class="s0">Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application</span>
    <span class="s0">to use the modified definitions.)</span>

    <span class="s0">b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the</span>
    <span class="s0">Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a</span>
    <span class="s0">copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,</span>
    <span class="s0">rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)</span>
    <span class="s0">will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if</span>
    <span class="s0">the user installs one, as long as the modified version is</span>
    <span class="s0">interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.</span>

    <span class="s0">c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at</span>
    <span class="s0">least three years, to give the same user the materials</span>
    <span class="s0">specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more</span>
    <span class="s0">than the cost of performing this distribution.</span>

    <span class="s0">d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy</span>
    <span class="s0">from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above</span>
    <span class="s0">specified materials from the same place.</span>

    <span class="s0">e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these</span>
    <span class="s0">materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</span>

  <span class="s0">For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the</span>
<span class="s0">Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for</span>
<span class="s0">reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,</span>
<span class="s0">the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is</span>
<span class="s0">normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major</span>
<span class="s0">components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on</span>
<span class="s0">which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies</span>
<span class="s0">the executable.</span>

  <span class="s0">It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license</span>
<span class="s0">restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally</span>
<span class="s0">accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot</span>
<span class="s0">use both them and the Library together in an executable that you</span>
<span class="s0">distribute.</span>

  <span class="s0">7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the</span>
<span class="s0">Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library</span>
<span class="s0">facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined</span>
<span class="s0">library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on</span>
<span class="s0">the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise</span>
<span class="s0">permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</span>

    <span class="s0">a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work</span>
    <span class="s0">based on the Library, uncombined with any other library</span>
    <span class="s0">facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the</span>
    <span class="s0">Sections above.</span>

    <span class="s0">b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact</span>
    <span class="s0">that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining</span>
    <span class="s0">where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</span>

  <span class="s0">8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute</span>
<span class="s0">the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any</span>
<span class="s0">attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or</span>
<span class="s0">distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your</span>
<span class="s0">rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,</span>
<span class="s0">or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses</span>
<span class="s0">terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</span>

  <span class="s0">9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</span>
<span class="s0">signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or</span>
<span class="s0">distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are</span>
<span class="s0">prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by</span>
<span class="s0">modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the</span>
<span class="s0">Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</span>
<span class="s0">all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying</span>
<span class="s0">the Library or works based on it.</span>

  <span class="s0">10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the</span>
<span class="s0">Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</span>
<span class="s0">original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library</span>
<span class="s0">subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</span>
<span class="s0">restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.</span>
<span class="s0">You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with</span>
<span class="s0">this License.</span>

  <span class="s0">11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</span>
<span class="s0">infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),</span>
<span class="s0">conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</span>
<span class="s0">otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</span>
<span class="s0">excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot</span>
<span class="s0">distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</span>
<span class="s0">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you</span>
<span class="s0">may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent</span>
<span class="s0">license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by</span>
<span class="s0">all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then</span>
<span class="s0">the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to</span>
<span class="s0">refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</span>

<span class="s0">If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any</span>
<span class="s0">particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,</span>
<span class="s0">and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</span>

<span class="s0">It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any</span>
<span class="s0">patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any</span>
<span class="s0">such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the</span>
<span class="s0">integrity of the free software distribution system which is</span>
<span class="s0">implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made</span>
<span class="s0">generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed</span>
<span class="s0">through that system in reliance on consistent application of that</span>
<span class="s0">system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing</span>
<span class="s0">to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot</span>
<span class="s0">impose that choice.</span>

<span class="s0">This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to</span>
<span class="s0">be a consequence of the rest of this License.</span>

  <span class="s0">12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in</span>
<span class="s0">certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the</span>
<span class="s0">original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add</span>
<span class="s0">an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,</span>
<span class="s0">so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus</span>
<span class="s0">excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if</span>
<span class="s0">written in the body of this License.</span>

  <span class="s0">13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new</span>
<span class="s0">versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.</span>
<span class="s0">Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,</span>
<span class="s0">but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</span>

<span class="s0">Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library</span>
<span class="s0">specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and</span>
<span class="s0">conditions either of that version or of any later version published by</span>
<span class="s0">the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a</span>
<span class="s0">license version number, you may choose any version ever published by</span>
<span class="s0">the Free Software Foundation.</span>

  <span class="s0">14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free</span>
<span class="s0">programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,</span>
<span class="s0">write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is</span>
<span class="s0">copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free</span>
<span class="s0">Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our</span>
<span class="s0">decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status</span>
<span class="s0">of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing</span>
<span class="s0">and reuse of software generally.</span>

                            <span class="s0">NO WARRANTY</span>

  <span class="s0">15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO</span>
<span class="s0">WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</span>
<span class="s0">EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR</span>
<span class="s0">OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY</span>
<span class="s0">KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE</span>
<span class="s0">IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR</span>
<span class="s0">PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE</span>
<span class="s0">LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME</span>
<span class="s0">THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</span>

  <span class="s0">16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN</span>
<span class="s0">WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY</span>
<span class="s0">AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU</span>
<span class="s0">FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR</span>
<span class="s0">CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE</span>
<span class="s0">LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING</span>
<span class="s0">RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A</span>
<span class="s0">FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF</span>
<span class="s0">SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH</span>
<span class="s0">DAMAGES.</span>

                     <span class="s0">END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</span>

<span class="s0">by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.</span>
<span class="s0">Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode</span>
<span class="s0">of using an interface provided by the Library.</span>

  <span class="s0">A &quot;Combined Work&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an</span>
<span class="s0">Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library</span>
<span class="s0">with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &quot;Linked</span>
<span class="s0">Version&quot;.</span>

  <span class="s0">The &quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&quot; for a Combined Work means the</span>
<span class="s0">Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code</span>
<span class="s0">for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are</span>
<span class="s0">based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.</span>

  <span class="s0">The &quot;Corresponding Application Code&quot; for a Combined Work means the</span>
<span class="s0">object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data</span>
<span class="s0">and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the</span>
<span class="s0">Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.</span>

  <span class="s0">1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.</span>

  <span class="s0">You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License</span>
<span class="s0">without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.</span>

  <span class="s0">2. Conveying Modified Versions.</span>

  <span class="s0">If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a</span>
<span class="s0">facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application</span>
<span class="s0">that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the</span>
<span class="s0">facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified</span>
<span class="s0">version:</span>

   <span class="s0">a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to</span>
   <span class="s0">ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the</span>
   <span class="s0">function or data, the facility still operates, and performs</span>
   <span class="s0">whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or</span>

   <span class="s0">b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of</span>
   <span class="s0">this License applicable to that copy.</span>

  <span class="s0">3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.</span>

  <span class="s0">The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from</span>
<span class="s0">a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object</span>
<span class="s0">code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated</span>
<span class="s0">material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure</span>
<span class="s0">layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates</span>
<span class="s0">(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:</span>

   <span class="s0">a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the</span>
   <span class="s0">Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are</span>
   <span class="s0">covered by this License.</span>

   <span class="s0">b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license</span>
   <span class="s0">document.</span>

  <span class="s0">4. Combined Works.</span>

  <span class="s0">You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,</span>
<span class="s0">taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the</span>
<span class="s0">portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse</span>
<span class="s0">engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of</span>
<span class="s0">the following:</span>

   <span class="s0">a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that</span>
   <span class="s0">the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are</span>
   <span class="s0">covered by this License.</span>

   <span class="s0">b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license</span>
   <span class="s0">document.</span>

   <span class="s0">c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during</span>
   <span class="s0">execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among</span>
   <span class="s0">these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the</span>
   <span class="s0">copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.</span>

   <span class="s0">d) Do one of the following:</span>

       <span class="s0">0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this</span>
       <span class="s0">License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form</span>
       <span class="s0">suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to</span>
       <span class="s0">recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of</span>
       <span class="s0">the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the</span>
       <span class="s0">manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying</span>
       <span class="s0">Corresponding Source.</span>

       <span class="s0">1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the</span>
       <span class="s0">Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time</span>
       <span class="s0">a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer</span>
       <span class="s0">system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version</span>
       <span class="s0">of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked</span>
       <span class="s0">Version.</span>

   <span class="s0">e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise</span>
   <span class="s0">be required to provide such information under section 6 of the</span>
   <span class="s0">GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is</span>
   <span class="s0">necessary to install and execute a modified version of the</span>
   <span class="s0">Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the</span>
   <span class="s0">Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If</span>
   <span class="s0">you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany</span>
   <span class="s0">the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application</span>
   <span class="s0">Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation</span>
   <span class="s0">Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL</span>
   <span class="s0">for conveying Corresponding Source.)</span>

  <span class="s0">5. Combined Libraries.</span>

  <span class="s0">You may place library facilities that are a work based on the</span>
<span class="s0">Library side by side in a single library together with other library</span>
<span class="s0">facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this</span>
<span class="s0">License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your</span>
<span class="s0">choice, if you do both of the following:</span>

   <span class="s0">a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based</span>
   <span class="s0">on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,</span>
   <span class="s0">conveyed under the terms of this License.</span>

   <span class="s0">b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it</span>
   <span class="s0">is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the</span>
   <span class="s0">accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</span>

  <span class="s0">6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.</span>

  <span class="s0">The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions</span>
<span class="s0">of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new</span>
<span class="s0">versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may</span>
<span class="s0">differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</span>

  <span class="s0">Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the</span>
<span class="s0">Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version</span>
<span class="s0">of the GNU Lesser General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and</span>
<span class="s0">conditions either of that published version or of any later version</span>
<span class="s0">published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you</span>
<span class="s0">received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser</span>
<span class="s0">General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser</span>
<span class="s0">General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</span>

  <span class="s0">If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide</span>
<span class="s0">whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall</span>
<span class="s0">apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is</span>
<span class="s0">permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the</span>
<span class="s0">Library.</span>

<span class="s0">Introduction</span>
<span class="s0">============</span>

  <span class="s0">The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;</span>
  <span class="s0">some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,</span>
  <span class="s0">various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the</span>
  <span class="s0">FreeType Project.</span>

  <span class="s0">This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and</span>
  <span class="s0">which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license</span>
  <span class="s0">affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,</span>
  <span class="s0">documentation and makefiles, at the very least.</span>

  <span class="s0">This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG</span>
  <span class="s0">(Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion</span>
  <span class="s0">and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products</span>
  <span class="s0">alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:</span>

    <span class="s0">o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be</span>
      <span class="s0">interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)</span>

    <span class="s0">o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or</span>
      <span class="s0">full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)</span>

    <span class="s0">o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use</span>
      <span class="s0">it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge</span>
      <span class="s0">somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the</span>
      <span class="s0">FreeType code. (`credits')</span>

  <span class="s0">We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this</span>
  <span class="s0">software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.</span>
  <span class="s0">We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and</span>
  <span class="s0">assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.</span>


  <span class="s0">Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a</span>
  <span class="s0">credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus</span>
  <span class="s0">encourage you to use the following text:</span>

<span class="s0">non-exclusive license:</span>

<span class="s0">(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)</span>
    <span class="s0">Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,</span>
    <span class="s0">modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its</span>

<span class="s0">2.2. Effective Date</span>

<span class="s0">The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution</span>
<span class="s0">become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first</span>
<span class="s0">distributes such Contribution.</span>

<span class="s0">2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope</span>

<span class="s0">The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under</span>
<span class="s0">this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the</span>
<span class="s0">distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.</span>
<span class="s0">Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a</span>
<span class="s0">Contributor:</span>

<span class="s0">(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;</span>
    <span class="s0">or</span>

<span class="s0">(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's</span>
    <span class="s0">modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its</span>
    <span class="s0">Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor</span>
    <span class="s0">Version); or</span>

<span class="s0">(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of</span>
    <span class="s0">its Contributions.</span>

<span class="s0">This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,</span>
<span class="s0">or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with</span>
<span class="s0">the notice requirements in Section 3.4).</span>

<span class="s0">2.4. Subsequent Licenses</span>

<span class="s0">No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to</span>
<span class="s0">distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this</span>
<span class="s0">License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if</span>
<span class="s0">permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).</span>

<span class="s0">2.5. Representation</span>

<span class="s0">Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its</span>
<span class="s0">Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights</span>
<span class="s0">to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.</span>

<span class="s0">2.6. Fair Use</span>

<span class="s0">This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under</span>
<span class="s0">applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other</span>
<span class="s0">equivalents.</span>

<span class="s0">2.7. Conditions</span>

<span class="s0">Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted</span>
<span class="s0">in Section 2.1.</span>

<span class="s0">3. Responsibilities</span>
<span class="s0">-------------------</span>

<span class="s0">3.1. Distribution of Source Form</span>

<span class="s0">All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any</span>
<span class="s0">Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under</span>
<span class="s0">the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source</span>
<span class="s0">Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this</span>
<span class="s0">License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not</span>
<span class="s0">attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code</span>
<span class="s0">Form.</span>

<span class="s0">3.2. Distribution of Executable Form</span>

<span class="s0">If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:</span>

<span class="s0">(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code</span>
    <span class="s0">Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of</span>
    <span class="s0">the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code</span>
    <span class="s0">Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more</span>
    <span class="s0">than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and</span>

<span class="s0">(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this</span>
    <span class="s0">License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the</span>
    <span class="s0">license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter</span>
    <span class="s0">the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.</span>

<span class="s0">3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work</span>

<span class="s0">You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,</span>
<span class="s0">provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for</span>
<span class="s0">the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered</span>
<span class="s0">Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the</span>
<span class="s0">Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this</span>
<span class="s0">License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software</span>
<span class="s0">under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of</span>
<span class="s0">the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered</span>
<span class="s0">Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary</span>
<span class="s0">License(s).</span>

<span class="s0">3.4. Notices</span>

<span class="s0">You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices</span>
<span class="s0">(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,</span>
<span class="s0">or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of</span>
<span class="s0">the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to</span>
<span class="s0">the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.</span>

<span class="s0">3.5. Application of Additional Terms</span>

<span class="s0">You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,</span>
<span class="s0">indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered</span>
<span class="s0">Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on</span>
<span class="s0">behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any</span>
<span class="s0">such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by</span>
<span class="s0">You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any</span>
<span class="s0">liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,</span>
<span class="s0">indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional</span>
<span class="s0">disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any</span>
<span class="s0">jurisdiction.</span>

<span class="s0">4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation</span>
<span class="s0">---------------------------------------------------</span>

<span class="s0">If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this</span>
<span class="s0">License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to</span>
<span class="s0">statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with</span>
<span class="s0">the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)</span>
<span class="s0">describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must</span>
<span class="s0">be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered</span>
<span class="s0">Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute</span>
<span class="s0">or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a</span>
<span class="s0">recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.</span>

<span class="s0">5. Termination</span>
<span class="s0">--------------</span>

<span class="s0">5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically</span>
<span class="s0">if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become</span>
<span class="s0">compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular</span>
<span class="s0">Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such</span>
